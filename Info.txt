"A modern C++ resource-management framework built with interfaces,
templates, smart pointers, and semantic ownership transfer."

Description:
    A type-safe and extensible resource management system powered by std::unique_ptr,
polymorphism, compile-time templates, and semantic ID-based ownership transfer.
    Designed to demonstrate clean architecture, strong ownership semantics,
and modern C++20 design principles.
